## Introduction to JavaScript: Navigating the First Two Weeks

As the second week of University comes to a close, it has been 2 weeks since I first started using Javascript, and so far, it’s interesting, to say the least. As someone familiar with Java, C, and C++ like many of our fellow students, I have to say that I see many similarities between the latter, but also many differences.

## Syntax Marvels in ES6: Unveiling the Versatility

Being a complete newbie to Javascript, I wasn’t sure about the benefits of Javascript, and why it was used for web development. I also, like many, thought Java and Javascript had some sort of correlation between the two of them. Quickly I have been proven completely wrong. Syntax (especially in ES6) such as spread operators, variable types, the way we use functions, how it can have any return type, as well as heterogeneous collection types, show how versatile Javascript can be. With my previous knowledge and experiences with past programming languages, however, I feel like it was able to allow me to understand Javascript faster, especially with the topic of heterogeneous collection types.

## Unlocking the Power of JavaScript: A Software Engineering Perspective

I think that Javascript is a really good programming language, looking at it from a software engineering perspective. As I mentioned, upon entering this class I had no prior knowledge whatsoever about Javascript. However, I have learned that it is extremely versatile and that it can be used in both frontend and backend development. We can also pair Javascript with frameworks such as React and Meteor, which we will both learn in class later this semester, to push Javascript to create dynamic and innovative projects solely from JS. While there may be other languages that are more suited for specific projects, maybe being more object-oriented making Java a better choice, or a need for manual memory manipulation, making C and C++ a better choice due to their allocation control, Javascript has its strengths that make it a universally great choice.

## Strengths of JavaScript: A Universally Great Choice

In addition to the new programming language some of us are just now learning, I was introduced to a new style of learning, athletic software engineering, and the new addition of WODs, or Workouts of the Day. I feel that, while it does add more stress, and is slightly less enjoyable, especially knowing the conditions of the WODs, it is realistic for the world of software engineering, and is a great way to exercise our problem-solving skills, as well as programming skills. As WODs are timed, efficiency is key. While the first attempts at WODs may lack, what is the aim of athletic software engineering is improvement through repetition and proficient problem-solving, which I why I think WODs are a stressful, but efficient way of learning the material.

## Conclusion: Navigating the Dynamic Landscape of JavaScript and Software Engineering

As the semester progresses, I know I will have more to say about Javascript, but for now, I feel that Javascript is a very exciting and new opening into the world of software engineering and web development that I am looking forward to traversing and utilizing more to it’s fullest extent.
